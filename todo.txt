data.json: add transcript, math questions, etc
train.py: with the way I split the data now it might have uneven splits and lead to an inaccurate model. Since we have so little data
          Maybe cosnidering dedicate the whole data.json as training data and create another separate test set.

Create a validation set and stuff
