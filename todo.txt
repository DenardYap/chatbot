data.json: add transcript, math questions, etc
train.py: with the way I split the data now it might have uneven splits and lead to an inaccurate model. Since we have so little data
          Maybe cosnidering dedicate the whole data.json as training data and create another separate test set.

Create a validation set and stuff

Figure out how to not answer questions that we are not trained on
Add Context, like a state-machine

Fix the stemmer in js is different from the one in Python 
- Possible solutions
1) MOST TEDIOUS
- make a backend to only python or javascript
2) Find the same algorithm 

TODO:
1) Voice OVer
2) Find out why model is so underfit
- ("maybe because stemming algorithm is diff?")
3) Figure out how to not answer questions or at least try to mitigate that
4) Fix stemming algorithm issue âœ“
5) Add Context
6) Add UI and stuff
7) Encode numbers as numbers, not text
8) Remove punctuations from the transcript
